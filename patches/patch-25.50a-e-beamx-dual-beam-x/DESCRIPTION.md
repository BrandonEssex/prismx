## Goals
- Render symmetric X-shaped beam in top-right
- Two beams (╱╲) connect into the border, same color
- Other two beams (╲╱) are status-indicating, different color
- Center glyph is visual prism: ✦, ✧, ◉
- Remove corner border where control beams intersect
- Ensure the BeamX logo stays anchored regardless of overlay
