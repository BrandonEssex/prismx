# Patch 25.51p – BeamX Directional Flow + Consistent Pulse

## Goals
- Animate entry beams (`⇙`) with directional flow toward `X`
- Animate exit beams (`⬉`, `⬊`) with consistent flow away from `X`
- Beam direction is preserved; glyphs reflect intensity, not direction
- Border pulses in sync with beam exit animation
