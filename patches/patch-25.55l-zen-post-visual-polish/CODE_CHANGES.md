## Code Changes

- Reduces timestamp font size and opacity; moves it to top-right or above post subtly
- Uses a clean left margin + padding to frame each post as a vertical card
- Adds horizontal divider with subtle dim styling between posts
- Optional: prefix each post with a glyph avatar (☀️ 🌘 🕛) based on time-of-day
- Ensures posts always start aligned, with breathing room around them
- Input box remains at bottom but visually separated with soft padding or a separator
