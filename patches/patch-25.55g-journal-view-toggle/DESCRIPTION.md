# Patch 25.55g – Zen Journal View Toggle

Adds a new toggle in Zen mode to switch between:
1. Compose Mode — focused entry box for journaling (Twitter-like)
2. Review Mode — scrollable pane of all entries from today, rendered with padding

Each mode respects Zen’s document-style formatting, but gives the user control over how they engage with their thoughts.
