# Patch 25.62c â€“ Zen Image Drop + Attachment Parser

Adds ability to embed screenshots or image files directly into the Zen journal. Dragging a PNG/JPG onto the terminal or pasting image data creates a new `Attachment` entry with an optional caption below. Images render as padded thumbnails and respect terminal width limits.

This patch also lays groundwork for future Markdown embed support, an external viewer, and a local media cache.
