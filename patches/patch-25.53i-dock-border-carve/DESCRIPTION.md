# Patch 25.53i â€“ Border-Carved Dock Escape (Vertical Bypass)

## Goals
- Render glyphs embedded into the bottom-left corner of the frame
- Maintain a visual break in the vertical border (`\__`)
- Stack up to 5 glyphs vertically, each ending with `|`
- Merge visually into the main bottom line border
