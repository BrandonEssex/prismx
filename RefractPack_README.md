## 🧊 RefractPack: Terminal Power Modules for PrismX

> **RefractPack** is the official PrismX extension suite — a curated, modular set of plugins, overlays, and smart dashboards designed to enhance your productivity without clutter.

### ✨ What's in the RefractPack?

- ⚡ **Plugin Launcher** (`Ctrl+Space`)
- 🧠 **Smart Suggestions** from node metadata
- 📊 **Dashboard Panels** for tools like `glow`, `gping`, `ripgrep`
- 🧾 **Visual EULA & Permissions**
- 🔧 **Plugin DevKit** (create, debug, reload your own plugins)
- 🔁 **Cron editor, alert system, help overlays, sandbox status**, and much more

All panels and tools load **only when activated** and can be **disabled, reordered, or themed** from the config files.

### 🧩 Designed to Be Modular

Even though it's installed by default, RefractPack:

- Is completely **opt-in at runtime**
- Can be **disabled per plugin** in `plugins.json`
- Integrates only when you toggle panels, open launchers, or activate tools
- Is fully customizable via:
  - `plugins.json`
  - `layout.json`
  - `keymap.json`
  - `profiles/`
