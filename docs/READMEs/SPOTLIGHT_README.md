✅ #GENESIS Spotlight Module – README Delivery
Below is the fully detailed, copy-paste–ready README.md for the Spotlight Search Module in the PrismX system.

# 🔍 PrismX Spotlight Search Module

The **Spotlight** module is a fast, fuzzy-search overlay for quickly locating and acting on notes, tasks, projects, or plugin-injected content within the PrismX ecosystem. Inspired by macOS Spotlight and productivity toolkits, it provides real-time predictive suggestions, scoped search, and inline actions—all accessible via a global shortcut.

## ⚡ Features

- 🔎 **Fuzzy search** across all data types (notes, tasks, projects, plugin types)
- 🎯 **Scoped search** (`All`, `Notes`, `Todos`, `Projects`)
- ⭐ **Favorites system** with predictive ranking based on usage
- 🛠️ **Inline actions**: move, delete, export, favorite
- 🧩 **Plugin extensibility**: register custom searchable types
- 🖥️ **Centered TUI overlay**, responsive redraw
- 📄 **Markdown export** with UID-based file naming
- 🐛 **Debug mode** toggle (`Ctrl+D`) for diagnostics
- 📋 **Extreme logging** (`spotlight.log`) for every query, action, and error

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut     | Action                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| `Ctrl+/`     | Toggle Spotlight overlay         |
| `↑ / ↓`      | Navigate search results          |
| `Enter`      | Open selected item               |
| `Esc`        | Close overlay                    |
| `m`          | Move selected item to another shard |
| `x`          | Delete selected item (with prompt) |
| `e`          | Export item to `.md`             |
| `f`          | Toggle favorite pin              |
| `Ctrl+D`     | Toggle debug overlay             |

---

## 🔄 Inline Actions

- `m`: Prompt to move item to another shard (e.g., `work`, `archive`)
- `x`: Confirm delete of the selected item
- `e`: Exports current item to `exports/ITEM_ID.md`
- `f`: Pin/unpin item for boosted ranking

---

## 🧠 Predictive Scoring

Spotlight reorders results using a combination of:
- Fuzzy match score
- Favorite pinning
- Access frequency
- Recent usage boost (last 30 days)

Pinned items always appear at the top unless overridden by an exact match.

## 🔌 Plugin Integration

To make custom items searchable:

```rust
pub trait Searchable {
    fn uid(&self) -> String;
    fn searchable_text(&self) -> String;
    fn display_title(&self) -> String;
    fn category(&self) -> SearchScope;
    fn metadata(&self) -> Option<HashMap<String, String>>;
}
Then register your type:

pub trait SearchableSource {
    fn name(&self) -> String;
    fn items(&self) -> Vec<Arc<dyn Searchable>>;
}

// Register at runtime:
register_plugin_source(Box::new(MyPluginData {}));
Plugins will auto-appear in Spotlight results and respect scoping and ranking rules.
