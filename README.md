# PrismX: Modular Offline Planning System

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.0.0--rc--final-blue)

PrismX is a high-performance, modular, offline-first planning environment built around an intelligent mindmap interface. Designed for engineers, creators, and focused teams, it merges structured planning, dynamic tagging, plugin extensibility, and real-time visual state feedback.

---

## Features

### Core Modules

* **Mindmap-Centric Planning**: Everything is a node. Projects, tasks, ideas, todos.
* **Inbox/Triage View**: Rapid-capture task dumping, with review workflow.
* **Scratchpad / Zen Mode**: Clean interface for writing, outlining, or decompressing.
* **Shortcut-Driven Navigation**: All features controllable via keyboard.

### Intelligent Icon System

* Prism-based icon rendered in TUI corner
* Beam directions reflect subsystem state:

  * Green = Zen Mode
  * Blue = Work Context
  * Red = Urgent Tasks
  * Lavender = Notes
* Animated pulse, sweep, flash based on priority or plugin signals
* Hover and click feedback (if supported by terminal)

### Drop Intelligence

* Drag-and-drop file/URL capture
* Contextual tag + subsystem routing
* Beam reactions on drop
* Plugin intercept hooks (`MindTrace`, `Inbox`, `Vault`, etc.)

### Plugin System

* WASM runtime with sandboxed plugin execution
* Live plugin beam hooks
* Plugin dashboard panel
* Drop schema declaration (accepted MIME, priority)

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Rust (>= 1.70.0)

## Configuration

### `settings.toml` Example:

```toml
[prismx_icon]
enabled = true
position = "top_right"
default_mode_color = "blue"
show_expand_panel = true

[prismx_icon.color_modes]
zen = "green"
work = "blue"
personal = "lavender"
urgent = "red"

[prismx_icon.animation]
pomodoro_active = "pulse:green"
task_due = "flash:orange"

[[prismx_icon.shard_array]]
plugin = "pomodoro"
color = "green"
position = "right"

[[prismx_icon.shard_array]]
plugin = "notes"
color = "lavender"
position = "top"
```
